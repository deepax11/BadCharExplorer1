# BreakingBadCharExplorer

Dear Reviwer,

I have done what could I have done in my free time. I think I have completed all requirements. Though did not test thoroughly.

##1. Created NetworkKit similar to what I have been using in my current project.
I kept it simple with minimum interface.
Also added simple test case to demonstrate how can we test our own custom network client

##2. Created DTOKit to parse APIResponse. 
Made it generic so that it reduces the boilerplates for additional APIRequests.
Addd simple test case to demonstate how can we test against APIEndpoint.

##3. Added a Flow (FlowProtocol) and RootFlow for intitial presentation and navigation of ViewControllers

##4. Implemented MVVM architecture to render the list screen

Please note that I have create few reusable classes/struct/extension which can be good usecase to dump in new module SharedKit.
Please also note that I added test cases around view models to which should give enough hint about my approch
